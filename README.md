# Emotion-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
  **"Built a text-based Emotion Detection system using ML and NLP in Python. Applied preprocessing (tokenization, stop-words, lemmatization, TF-IDF, embeddings) and trained Naive Bayes, SVM, and fine-tuned BERT. The system predicts emotions like joy, anger, fear, sadness, and surprise in real time with confidence scores."**
