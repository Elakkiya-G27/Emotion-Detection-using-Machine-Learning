Emotion Detection System using Machine Learning & NLP

Developed a text-based Emotion Detection system using Python, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Implemented comprehensive text preprocessing including tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings. Trained and evaluated multiple models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a fine-tuned BERT model to improve classification performance.
The system accurately predicts emotions such as joy, anger, fear, sadness, and surprise from user input text and provides real-time predictions with confidence scores.
